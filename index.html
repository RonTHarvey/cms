      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro"> Known on the internet as Ron Credible I am an up and coming web developer
        from Queens, NY. My two biggest interest are fashion and music. In fashion
        I pay a lot of attention to the "hypebeast" culture which has to do with
        exclusivity and knowing when to shop. As for music I listen to mostly
        Hip-Hop and R&B, on Apple Music I host a playlist that I update monthly
        with new music. I currently work at the YMCA as a Swim Instuctor
        and I also supervise a special needs camp during the summer,
        both positions I find very rewarding. In my free time I hold a
        position as a Label Executive at 2G Music Group, a buzzing Record Label
        in the New York City underground scene. This is where I display my
        creativity most whether it be assisting in writing songs, picking beats,
        co-directing videos, styling artist, and even hosting shows where I can
        display material to people who come out to watch. I am really into helping
        people and have an eye for detail and thats why I am entering this field,
        in order to have a hand in making others visions come to light online.</p>

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>

        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>Withouth knowing the proper name for it I've been interested in
          coding since I was 12 years old. I would remember codes to layout my
          Myspace page, and would later revisit coding when I had to do the same
          thing for Tumblr. I am fluent in most front-end and back-end languages
          and I am constantly brushing up on skills, whether it be taking a
          course online or practicing on projects of my own.</p>

        <h3>Photo & Video Editing</h3>
        <p>Everything we see online these days has been edited before it is
          displayed for everyone to see. I am fluent in Final Cut Pro and Adobe
          Photoshop. On my instagram you can see most of my work where I edit all
          of my personal photos. As for video editing I am currently working
          working on a comedy based lifestyle vlog where all the videos will be
          edited by me.</p>
